# 3D-RUBIKS-CUBE-SIMULATOR
This project is a 3D Rubik's Cube Simulator built with React. It allows users to interact with a virtual Rubik's Cube, simulating the classic 3x3 puzzle in 3D space. The cube can be rotated, and users can apply rotations to the faces, mimicking real-world manipulation of the puzzle.
